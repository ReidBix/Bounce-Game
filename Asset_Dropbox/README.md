Asset Dropbox
---

A place for finished assets (e.g. music and art) to be placed; from here, they will be moved to the appropriate directory in the Unity project.

NOTE: Do not move files into the Unity project within file explorer. Instead, drag and drop the file from file explorer into the Unity IDE. This lets Unity generate the appropriate metadata files.
