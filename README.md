Getting started
---
If you're collaborating on this project and need help setting up, please head over to the Wiki (on the right sidebar) and read the "quickstart" articles on setting up GitHub and Unity (start with GitHub, and then Unity). By the end you should be able to play a small prototype of the game.

If you need help with Unity specifically, read "Unity pointers" on the wiki, read up on Unity [reference manuals](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html), play around with the sandbox scene, and download a sample 2D platformer from the Asset Store.

Jobs by role
---
* Programming - Head over to the GitHub Issues page to find issues you are assigned to. If you need work, assign yourself to an issue nobody else is working on.
* Art/Music - You'll be tasked directly.
* Design/Writing - Work in your groups to create sketches of levels, and place them in the Concept Dropbox. Make placeholder art for environmental objects. Document things that artists and programmers need to work on. If someone on your team is comfortable with Unity, have that person stitch levels together with the placeholder art.
