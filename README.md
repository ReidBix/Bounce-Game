Bounce
===========

Bounce is a 2D platforming game made in the fall of 2014 + spring of 2015 by Student Game Developers in the University of Virginia.

Getting Started
---
If you're collaborating on this project and need help setting up, please head over to the Wiki (on the right sidebar) and read the "quickstart" articles on setting up GitHub and Unity (start with GitHub, and then Unity). By the end you should be able to play a small prototype of the game.

If you need help with Unity specifically, read "Unity pointers" on the wiki, read up on Unity [reference manuals](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html), play around with the sandbox scene, and/or download a sample 2D platformer from the Asset Store.
