[Well, well, well. If it isn't... {Line 2}]
[Wait, what was your name again? Were you Roberto? {}][No. {Line 3}][Si. {Line 4}]
[Well, whatever. You're a head, so I figure you must be a Rob or a Bob or something. {Line 5}]
[Really? Wow, I could have sworn you were Bob. Oh well. {Line 5}]
[In any case, you may have noticed your sad little leg sitting on that platform over there! {}][Yeah? {Line 8}][What leg? {Line 6}]
[...Seriously? Is my role as a villain going to be completely ignored? {Line 7}]
[I feel so underappreciated. {Line 8}]
[Well, anyway, your leg is over there! All alone! {Line 9}]
[I totally didn't lose it or anything. {Line 10}]
[It's not like I got it stuck and now can't get it back. {Line 11}]
[Ahem... this is a bit awkward, actually. {Line 12}]
[I didn't exactly expect you to follow me into space {Line 13}]
[I mean, villain's code of conduct demands that I let you have a go at your leg, so... {Line 14}]
[And frankly I'm not getting it back anyway. {Line 15}]
[So, have fun leaping through space! Ahahahaha! {End, set TalkedToRob}]

[Hahahahahaha! {Line 19}]
[Hahh.... okay that was funny for like 4 seconds. {Line 20}]
[I could make this a bit more interesting, I bet. {Line 21}]
[Hmm... how to make this more fun... {Line 22}]
[I GOT IT! *snaps* {Line 23, Event GirdersInSpace}]
