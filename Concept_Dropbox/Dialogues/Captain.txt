[I’ve been Rob’d! {Line 10}]

[Yarrgh, lad. Yer slower than tha’ molasses flood from the days when I was still green. What kind of complications? {Line 11}]
[Yarrgh, back in my youth, they’d keelhaul yer fer being such a weakling. What happened? Where’d the robber go? {Line 11}]

[He was really strange and really sadistic! I was minding own business, trying to get to my room, when next thing I know, POOF! He got my body! The last thing I remember is seeing random parts fly towards the jungle, and the rest flying towards the city!]
[Yarrgh, I have a soft spot fer helpless landlubbers.  I’ll instruct me crew to point the chase guns towards the jungle and the city and to wait until yer all fixed up. You’ll get there quicker if we shoot yer there. Make sure to use the cannon on the stern to get to the jungle, and the cannon on the bow to get to the city. {End, set CaptainAgreesToHelp}]
