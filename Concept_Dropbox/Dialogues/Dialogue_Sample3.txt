#Example One: Fancier Options
#===
#This example just demonstrates some of the features I didn't show off in the 
#other files. First, you can combine values in an if-statement in Python-esque
#fashion (i.e. using "and", "or", "not" and parentheses). Second, the "Event"
#indicator next to a line shows that something in the game environment can be
#triggered (in this case, opening a gate).

[You need the boss's permission to get through. Sorry.{End, Set TalkedToGuard}]

if GateIsOpen
[What's up, dude?{End}]

if (TalkedToGuard and HasGatePermission) and not GateIsOpen
[You may pass through! Have a nice day!{End, Event OpenGate}]

if TalkedToGuard and not HasGatePermission
