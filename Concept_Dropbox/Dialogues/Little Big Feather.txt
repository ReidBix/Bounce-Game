#Little Big Feather
#Ovular, tall head with headdress of feathers coming down on one side
#For use in the Treetop Village of the Jungle-Beach-Water world

[Ahoy, comrade Bob! Welcome to our treetop retreat!{Line 2}]
[What can I do for ya today?{}] [...why is everyone up here?{Line 3}][Isn't your name a little...contradictory?{Line 9}]
[When Rob raided the coast, he chased all of us good folk up here!{Line 4}]
[He's still down there somewhere...but things are working out pretty nifty for us, so why go back?{}][Isn't anyone left down there?{Line 5}]
[Only one crazy old fisherman and that thrice-danged parrot of his!{Line 6}]
[It's real ballsy of 'em, I'm telling ya. You're not heading on down there, are ya?{}][I need my body back! Of course I am!{Line 7}]
[Who said you could, huh? Huh? I'm still chief 'round here, aren't I?{}][King Robert said I could!{Line 8}]
[Ah, well in that case, go right ahead.{End, set TalkedToLittleBigFeather}]
[Excuuuuuuuse me?{}][Little Big...that doesn't make any sense. What are you, a famous warrior of some sort?{Line 10}]
[You don't make any sense. And sense doesn't make any of you, either, ya hear?{Line 11}]
[You sure got some balls, talking to me like that. Now bring me that feather, kid!{}][Make me, you warhead!{Line 12, Event CareensIntoBob}]
[Pick!{Line 13, Event CareensIntoBob}]
[It!{Line 14, Event CareensIntoBob}]
[Up!{Event BobPicksUpFeather}][Here. Another for your headdress.{Line 15}]
[Ah, she's a beauty!{Line 16}]
[And a warhead's a bomb, little Bob, not a warrior with only a head.{End, set TalkedToLittleBigFeather}]
