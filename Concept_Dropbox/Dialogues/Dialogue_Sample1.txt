Example One: Dialogue for a Quest
===
In this example, the player steps through the right interactions to accept a quest. 
After accepting, the NPC will repeat the bottom line until "HasMed" is set (which 
would occur when the player gets the right item). After the quest, the NPC will 
keep repeating the "if DeliveredMed" line. Note that the if-statements will be 
evaluated first to determine the starting line; if none are true, then the dialogue
opens with the first line in the file.
