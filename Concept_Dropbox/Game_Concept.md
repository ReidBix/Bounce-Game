Bounce game concept (from week 1 brainstorming)
===

Bounce is a 2D platformer where you play as the head of Bob, who is trying to recover his body from the villain, Rob.

Plot
---
Gameplay opens with Bob, the protagonist, running around a generic platforming stage, enjoying his normal life. He soon encounters a strange new person named Rob, and in spite of his attempts at courtesy, he gets zapped with a powerful spell. When he wakes up, he discovers that Rob has stolen his body! As he later learns, he is just one of several victims who have had body parts stolen by Rob, as "punishment" for having a similar name.

To recover his body parts, Bob must chase after Rob through several stages. Along the way he will meet other characters, find collectibles, and possibly assist some members of the population.

Gameplay
---
Specific mechanics:
* Lateral movement, i.e. left and right
* Jumping/Bouncing
* Talking to NPCs; navigating and confirming dialgoue options
* Activating a powerup that has been picked up
* Viewing and navigating the in-game menu, from which one can save, teleport, and view inventory

The game will start with a tutorial level - a small part will include control of Bob with his body. After he loses it, though, the rest of the level will teach the player how to manipulate Bob's head. It will introduce generic environmental variables like moving platforms, as well as powerups.

After going through this level, the player will arrive at the hub of the universe, where there are NPCs, as well as passages to all the worlds (levels/stages) in the game.

Since the player can choose from any world at the start, all the worlds will have roughly equivalent difficulty. The difficulty will escalate within each world. Each world should take roughly 30 minutes to complete; there will be checkpoints roughly 5 minutes apart where the player can save his progress (to be more specific, the player can save anytime, but he will only start from a checkpoint when he boots up the game). The player can also teleport to any checkpoint he has already visited, in case he wants to repeat a part of the world.

Between these checkpoints will be platforming -- each world will be centered around a specific powerup (or set of powerups) that will make level design unique. A powerup is something the player picks up from the environment and is able to hold on to for some time (it will expire if it is held for too long). The player then presses a button to activate the powerup, and there will be specific controls for each powerup (most will just involve movement; the controls should not be sophisticated). The powerup will also expire after time, or when the player cancels it. 

The environment will also factor into level design; some environmental objects can affect bounciness, friction, and other physical attributes of a level. Hazards will also be present in the environment, in the form of spikes/lava/deadly substance, bottomless voids, and enemies with rudimentary AI. For the most part the player will need to avoid these hazards. If he touches a hazard he will die in one hit; however, there will be various respawn points in the levels to prevent inordinate amounts of replaying (note: the player cannot save at these respawn points, i.e. they cannot track progress between playthoughs).

The worlds will also have collectible items, most of which are to be collected for the player's satisfaction. These collectibles will be placed in hard to reach areas to provide a greater challenge to those who seek more difficulty out of the game.

NPCs will be present throughout each world. Most of them will just provide some depth to the game universe, and possibly comic relief. Some will offer hints on how to proceed through a set of obstacles. Some will have quests (e.g. fetch an item, talk to someone else); some of these quests may be necessary to proceed in a level, although most will be for the player's satisfaction. The victims of Rob will be the most significant set of NPCs; some might offer you help with the level.

At the end of each world the player will encounter Rob -- some (more difficult) platforming will follow, after which Rob will drop a body part and run away. Level complete!

After the player collects all but one body part, he will have access to the final level, which will integrate all the powerup mechanics the player has learned. The most difficult level designs will be here. The level will end with Rob's demise, and Bob will finally have recovered all of his body.

Style
---
Despite its somewhat gruesome storyline, the game aims to be comedic; this will be reflected in interactions with NPCs, non sequiturs and oddities in level design, and the general vibe (with art and music) of the game. Cheap or cheesy humor is appreciated, but genuine humor is the goal.

Which isn't to say that there can't be some serious substories going on with NPCs -- if we can think of interesting or captivating plot lines for the game, then we should put them in. The game shouldn't be taking itself too seriously, though.

For art, we will be doing pretty much all pixel art, although for the backgrounds of stages a more realistic backdrop may be preferred. Colors should tend to be bright and happy. I'm happy with any art as long as it conveys its physical/mechanic purpose and the style is not inconsistent across levels.

The music should be tied to the art; it should reflect the happy, comedic theme. I personally would go for chiptunes, electronica, and/or warm organic sounds. I leave the decision to the musicians, though. In general, the music for each world should be ambient enough that the player can listen to it for 20-30 minutes without getting tired/bored. Having loopable music is always appreciated.

Sound effects should go along with the theme as best they can, although the main goal is that they convey their physical/mechanic purpose.

Misc. Details
---
* The hero is a head, so he will be swallowing all the pickups in the environment; if he needs to retrieve something from his inventory, he will spit it back out. Powerups can be designed as foods to coincide with the ingestion "mechanic."
* Powerups are called "thingamabobs." Rob hates them, understandably.
* Some powerup ideas include turbo (move quickly), super-bouncy (self explanatory), spiky (for hazard protection), spiderball (for moving up walls), balloon (moving up slowly), boulder (moving through water)
* The Bob-with-body that the player controls at the beginning will be very fun, and almost overpowered. It can run quickly, climb on walls, and jump infinitely.
* Some parts of levels might have cool looking orchestrated platforming sequences (e.g. a series of springs) for visual appeal.
