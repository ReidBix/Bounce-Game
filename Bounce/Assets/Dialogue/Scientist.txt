[You, sir! You look like a smart fellow! {Line 2}]
[There must be a lot of brains in that big head of yours. {Line 3}]
[So clearly, you understand that we must be on the forefront of technology! {}][What are you talking about? {Line 4}][How did you get up here? {Line 8}]
[Teleportation, my dear head! Teleportation! {Line 5}]
[It is the key to the future, and I have the lock! {Line 6}]
[Er, or however that expression goes. {Line 7}]
[And you, sir, have just made yourself one very lucky volunteer! {}][Wait wait wait, what??? {Line 10}][Did you teleport up here, then? {Line 13}]
[That is inconsequential! {Line 9}]
[More importantly, you have just made yourself one very lucky volunteer! {}][Volunteer for what? {Line 10}][No, seriously, how did you get up here? {Line 13}]
[Well, it just so happens that I need someone to test my teleporter. {Line 11}]
[And it just so happens that YOU arrived right as I needed one! {Line 12}]
[So of course, YOU'LL be the one to test it, yes? {}][Yes. {Line 16}][No! {Line 19}]
[Eh, I took the elevator up. {Line 14}]
[Now, about your gracious volunteering...{Set TalkedToScientistOnce}]

if TalkedToScientistOnce
[I'll just need you to step into this teleporter for me. {}][Okay.{Line 16}][No way!{Line 19}]
[Excellent! Now, this won't hurt a bit. {Line 17}]
[Although you may be a bit... discombobulated. {Line 18}]
[And I can personally guarantee you won't lose any limbs! {End, Event ActivateTeleporter}]
[...What? {Line 20}]
[Well, I'll just activate my teleporter anyway. {Line 21}]
[You might have second thoughts, after all. {Line 22}]
[Besides, the only other way out of here is a long drop into a row of spikes. {End, Event ActivateTeleporter}]

if TeleporterActive
[Oh, I suppose I should have mentioned before...{Line 24}]
[I don't actually know where the other teleporter is. {Line 25}]
[I've been sending other teleporters through to find out, but... {Line 26}]
[Tests have been... inconclusive. {Line 27}]
[You probably won't end up in space or anything. {Line 28}]
[Just don't worry about it too much. Good luck! {End}]
