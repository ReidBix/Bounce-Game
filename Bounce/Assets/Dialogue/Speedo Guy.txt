#Speedo guy- A former believer in swim trunks. Now that he's converted, he won't stop praising the aerodynamic properties of Speedos.

[Every man deserves a satisfyingly springy pair of Speedos.{}] [I don't think I have the body for that kind of thing... {Line 2}] [Eww, gross. Nobody looks good in Speedos. Period. {Line 2}] [Spandex is a privilege, not a right. {Line 2}]

[You poor, poor, soul.] [Yeah, it's tough being a head. {Line 3}]

[How will you ever live life to the fullest when you can't even experience the satisfaction of gliding through the water...{Line 4}]
[...effortlessly as the water slides over the taut spandex of your Speedo?] [Actually, I've always been more of a swim trunks kind of guy. {Line 5}]

[I pity you even more! To be so young and to never be able to enjoy the pleasures of the spandex is surely a most terrible tragedy!] [No, I'm definitely getting my body back. {Line 6}]

[Marvelous! Make sure to come back when you can! Now that I think about it, I did see something flying towards the right over there... {End, Set TalkedToSpeedoGuy}]

if TalkedToSpeedoGuy choose 7,8
[Every man deserves a satisfyingly springy pair of Speedos.{End}]
[You should probably head to the right to see what's going on. (To be continued...?){End}]
